		<h2>Angular Expressions vs. JavaScript Expressions</h2>

		<pre>
			Angular expressions are like JavaScript expressions with the following differences:
			- Context: JavaScript expressions are evaluated against the global window. In Angular, expressions are evaluated against a scope object.
			- Forgiving: In JavaScript, trying to evaluate undefined properties generates ReferenceError or TypeError. In Angular, expression evaluation is forgiving to undefined and null.
			- Filters: You can use filters within expressions to format data before displaying it.
			- No Control Flow Statements: You cannot use the following in an Angular expression: conditionals, loops, or exceptions.
			- No Function Declarations: You cannot declare functions in an Angular expression, even inside ng-init directive.
			- No RegExp Creation With Literal Notation: You cannot create regular expressions in an Angular expression.
			- No Object Creation With New Operator: You cannot use new operator in an Angular expression.
			- No Bitwise, Comma, And Void Operators: You cannot use Bitwise, , or void operators in an Angular expression.
			- If you want to run more complex JavaScript code, you should make it a controller method and call the method from your view. If you want to eval() an Angular expression yourself, use the $eval() method.
