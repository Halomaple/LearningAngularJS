			As the name suggests, the isolate scope of the directive isolates everything except models that you've explicitly added to the scope: {} hash object.

			<my-customer></my-customer>

			Note: Normally, a scope prototypically inherits from its parent. An isolated scope does not. See the "Directive Definition Object - scope" section for more information about isolate scopes.
